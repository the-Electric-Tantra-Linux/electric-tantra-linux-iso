# README 

This is the Mahakali theme for LightDM Webkit2 Greeter, which is an alternative implementation of (essentially) a login screen and session selector for Linux desktop environments such as the Electric Tantra Linux.

## Features

- logins into the user's desktop environment of choice 
- uses custom artwork by the author 
- modern look and feel 

## Important Note

If you use the installer, it will copy a lightdm and lightdm-webkit2 conf to your system's configurations. You may choose not to use these, preferring your own configurations for one or another reasons and that is fine but you must **turn off the error checking** of the webkit2 greeter else the display manager will trip itself up and prevent you from logging in. Which is no fun so avoid doing that!


## Credit Where It Is Due
The team at Archcraft are the inspiration for this theme. I used no small amount of their code in making this lightdm interface, which I am highly grateful they had produced.
