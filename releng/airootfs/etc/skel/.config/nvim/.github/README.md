<h3 align="center">NeoVim Configuration</h3>

---

Ok so I rewrote the entire thing over again using an even more complicated but powerful configuration as a base [by CreativeNull](https://github.com/CreativeNull/nvim-config). There are a few things now trimmed out of the configuration (namely note managers as I have succumbed to Notion.so's convenience and ease of use once more).
