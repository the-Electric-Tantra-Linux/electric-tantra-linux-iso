# the Electric Tantra Linux ISO

To demonstrate my carefully constructed environment to interested third parties, I have cobbled together an arch-based iso file that is a replica of my environment that is easily redistributed and produces the precise environment I intend in virtual machines or on bare metal *just like that*. 

However, even using `tmpfs` to store the build artifacts, this whole process works out to a bit messy and makes for tedious testing when waiting 20 minutes for a new ISO build when something doesn't or does work.
